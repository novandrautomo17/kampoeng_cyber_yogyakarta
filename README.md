This project is one of my voluntary projects for Kampoeng Cyber Yogyakarta community.

Kampoeng Cyber Yogyakarta is a community located in one of the tourism centers of Tamansari Yogyakarta, where there are residents who work together to build an independent internet network so that all citizens who live in there can enjoy the affordable internet, simplify their online selling system, and make their internal communication more efficient.

Because Kampoeng Cyber is located in one of Yogyakarta's tourism centers, the aim of this project is to provide accurate information about Kampoeng Cyber and other near places (especially Tamansari). This is due to the frequent wrong historical information that tourists get from the guides there.

This project is written in Python 3.9 and the Django 2.2 framework, applies a function based view, and running on my virtual private server using Ubuntu 20.04 and Apache2 Web Server.
